Qingying He is currently a PhD candidate (expected to graduate in Dec 2025) at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Liu](https://weiliu2016.github.io/). She holds a BSc in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Northeastern University and an MSc in Computational Mathematical Finance (with Distinction, Top of the class) from the University of Edinburgh. Before starting her PhD, she worked as a quantitative options trader, specializing in market-making and high-frequency arbitrage strategies in derivative markets. Her research focuses on transportation network modeling, optimization, and data-driven decision-making, with an emphasis on multi-modal coordination across unmanned aerial, surface, and ground vehicles. Her work addresses complex challenges in planning, operations, and management under uncertainty to support the development of efficient, resilient, and sustainable mobility systems. Her research has been published in world-leading journals in the field, such as Transportation Research Part B: Methodological.
